When I was younger in elementary school, I had a really hard time learning to multiply bigger numebrs than twelve together by hand. I ended up struggling until my teacher pointed out different way for me to multiply that finally made sence for me. I ended up practicing it day and night to perfection and teaching my family how to do it to prove I was good at it.

## Discuss a situation where you worked with a team. How would you describe yourself as a teammate? Where can you improve your team skills? Be specific.

Personaly, I'm not fond of teams but I'm very good at being part of one. Depending on what I think my team needs, that ends up being the role I take up. I've been a leader on occasion and organized succeful ways for the team to finish the projects we were tasked with and I've been also been someone whe's taken the backseat and let others lead. When it comes to being in the backseat, I tend to communicate less so that would be where I'd practice on when working with others.

## What professional organizations would you like to join? What professional development would you like to be a part of in the next five years? Be specific and don't consider places of employment.

The organizations below are the organizations I would like to join. For the IET I always like bigger and better things so if I could be a part of making the world better with more advancements, that would make me happy. The ISSA is for a similar reason and the NCWIT is important to me just because I'm also a woman and I should support other woman to do the same jobs as me. In the furture in regards to development, at some point I would like to contribute to AI, just because it's something I personally think is cool and could prove instrumental to how the furute handles technology.

## What are the ways you can use the skills you have learned in CS to serve your community? Be specific.

I live out in the country so there wasn't a lot of interenet around me as I was growing up even when everyone else seemed to have it at their house. One way I could help my comminty is by working with the few internet providers near me to help spread it towards other parts of my community that have no internet still. I could also help teach those how to use technology better. Not everyone is very tech savvy where I live so I could use my skills to teach other to be better at using more advanced technology.
